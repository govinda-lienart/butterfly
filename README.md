Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing butterfly observation data to practice data manipulation and exploratory analysis skills. The dataset and guiding questions were generated using ChatGPT, providing a structured approach to enhance my proficiency with pandas and GitHub.

Key Features

	•	Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, converted data types, and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.
	•	Data Merging: Combined multiple datasets to provide a comprehensive view of the observations.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis: Identified trends, top contributors, and species diversity.
	•	Wingspan Analysis: Calculated and visualized the average wingspan for each butterfly species.
	•	GitHub Integration: Used raw CSV links hosted on GitHub for seamless data access.

Files in Repository

	•	butterfly_observations_extended.csv: Dataset containing extended butterfly observation data.
	•	species_details.csv: Contains wingspan and habitat details for each species.
	•	observer_contributions.csv: Tracks the total observations made by each observer.
